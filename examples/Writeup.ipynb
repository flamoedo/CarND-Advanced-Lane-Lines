    "#### The goals / steps of this project are the following:\n",
    "- Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.\n",
    "- Apply a distortion correction to raw images.\n",
    "- Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.\n",
    "- Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image (\"birds-eye view\").\n",
    "- Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.\n",
    "- Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.\n",
    "- Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.\n",
    "- Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle\n",
